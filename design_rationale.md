# First figure
The first figure is an annotated plot that explains the concept in the title of the guide. The first figure should be as self-contained and self-explanatory as much as possible.

# Links to relevant exemplars
Some readers may read only a specific section, instead of reading the entire FAQ. For the sections that are likely to be read in this fashion, add links to relevant exemplars at the end of each section.

# Misc additions
* Link and anchor between FAQ and Exemplar to aid navigation
